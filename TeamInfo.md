## Project Summary

The College Major Explorer will be an application designed to guide students with making more informed decisions when choosing a college major. A common issue nowadays is students entering college uncertain about the field they decide to pursue.
Our app will aim to help them choose their paths by giving them a deep insight on detailed career options and salary projections based on majors that align with their interests. 

The app will use real datasets from U.S. Department of Education statistics, IPEDS, and Kaggle to display relevant information such as average salaries, required skills, job growth rates, and educational paths for each major. It will serve as a comprehensive tool for prospective students planning their academic careers by combining this data with an intuitive user interface and interactive visualizations.
